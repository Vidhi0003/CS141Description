The Great 13 Puzzle

This was an individual project for my C++ class. The intention of this program is to create a board game that makes a series of moves until there is only one piece(peg) left. However, it is not easy to move the pegs as each move will require the peg to be moved adjacently such as, moving horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. A peg cannot overlap over another peg, either which is what makes this game more challenging for the user. I utilized abstractions and learned to utilize parameterized functions.

The starter code was provided by George Maratos and David Hayes
