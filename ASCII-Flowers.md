Project 1: ASCII-Flowers

This is a flower created using ASCII characters. This was one of the first projects I had done in C++. The purpose of the program is depending on how big the number inputted is, the flower becomes the size of the number. As I was new to C++, I learned how to utilize loops in C++. I also learned how to utilize setfill and setw.
